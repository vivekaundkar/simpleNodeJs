# Simple Node Website

This repo demonstrates a basic website using node.js.  
app.js demonstrates the same behavior as index.js, but uses the express framework.

index.js imports any required modules in order to imitate a file server while referencing any html files in the same directory, throwing an error if attempted access to a non-listed page occurs.

It supports these 4 pages on localhost:8080:

* / (index page)
* /about
* /contact-me
* 404 for anything not listed above
